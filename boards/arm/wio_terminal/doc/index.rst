+-----------+------------+------------------------------------------+

Other hardware features are not currently supported by Zephyr.

The default configuration can be found in the Kconfig file
:zephyr_file:`boards/arm/wio_terminal/wio_terminal_defconfig`.

Zephyr can use the default Cortex-M SYSTICK timer or the SAM0 specific RTC.
To use the RTC, set :code:`CONFIG_CORTEX_M_SYSTICK=n` and set
:code:`CONFIG_SYS_CLOCK_TICKS_PER_SEC` to no more than 32 kHZ divided by 7,
i.e. no more than 4500.

Connections and IOs
===================

The `Wio Terminal Getting started guide`_ has detailed information about
the board including `pinouts`_ and the `schematic`_.

System Clock
============

The SAMD51 MCU is configured to use the 32 kHz internal oscillator
with the on-chip PLL generating the 120 MHz system clock.

Serial Port
===========

The SAMD51 MCU has 6 SERCOM based USARTs. On the Wio Terminal, SERCOM3 is
the Zephyr console and is available on pins 10 (RX) and 8 (TX).

USB Device Port
===============

The SAMD51 MCU has a USB device port that can be used to communicate
with a host PC.  See the :ref:`usb-samples` sample applications for
more, such as the :ref:`usb_cdc-acm` sample which sets up a virtual
serial port that echos characters back to the host PC.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

The Wio Terminal ships with a the BOSSA compatible UF2 bootloader.  The
bootloader can be entered by quickly tapping the reset button twice.

Additionally, if :code:`CONFIG_USB_CDC_ACM` is enabled then the bootloader
will be entered automatically when you run :code:`west flash`. (Note: The board may not enter bootloader after the first `west flash` call)

Flashing
========

#. Build the Zephyr kernel and the :ref:`button` sample application:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/basic/button
      :board: wio_terminal 
      :goals: build
      :compact:

#. Swipe the reset/power button down twice quickly to enter bootloader mode

#. Flash the image:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/basic/button
      :board: wio_terminal 
      :goals: flash
      :compact:

   You should see the blue (user) LED flashing whenever you press the 
   third (counting from the top left) user button at the top of the
   Wio Terminal.

Debugging
=========

In addition to the built-in bootloader, the Wio Terminal can be flashed and
debugged using a SWD probe such as the Segger J-Link.

#.  Solder cables to the code:`SWCLK`, :code:`SWDIO`, :code:`RESET`,
    :code:`GND`, and :code:`3V3` pins. See `Test with SWD`_ for more
    information.

#. Connect the board to the probe by connecting the :code:`SWCLK`,
   :code:`SWDIO`, :code:`RESET`, :code:`GND`, and :code:`3V3` pins on the
   Wio Terminal to the :code:`SWCLK`, :code:`SWDIO`, :code:`RESET`, 
   :code:`GND`, and :code:`VTref` pins on the `J-Link`_.

#. Flash the image:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/basic/button
      :board: wio_terminal 
      :goals: flash -r openocd
      :compact:

#. Start debugging:

   .. zephyr-app-commands::
      :zephyr-app: samples/basic/button
      :board: wio_terminal 
      :goals: debug
      :compact:
